ROADMAP: 
Step 1. Create a working feed forward and test the pass
Step 2. Test the back propagation
Step 3. Complete data loading from a csv file
Step 4. Compare the performance against a python file

A layer class consists of the number of neurons present in the layer as well as
the weights and the bias. A static data member will keep count of the number
of layers in our class.

The neural network class will create k objects of the layer class, given that 
there are k layers in the network. Input and Output layer are considered and 
included in this count as well.
